# Human-in-the-loop (HITL) Best Practices

[中文](../zh-CN/hitl-best-practices.md)

HITL reviews tool calls before an Agent executes them. Use it to control high-risk operations, keep an audit trail, and let an Audit Agent take over routine approvals when human reviewers cannot keep up.

## Where To Configure

Open **System Settings → Human-in-the-loop** in the web UI. You can configure:

- Global default reviewer: `human` or `audit_agent`
- Approval engine: `hitl.audit_backend` (`openai` or `typesafe`)
- Dedicated Audit Agent model: `hitl.audit_model`
- Resolved audit log retention days
- No-approval tool allowlist: `hitl.tool_whitelist`
- Audit prompts for approval mode and review-edit mode

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
hitl:
  default_reviewer: human
  audit_backend: openai
  audit_model:
    provider: ""
    base_url: ""
    api_key: ""
    model: "" # set a small model here; blank reuses the default AI channel model
  retention_days: 90
  tool_whitelist: [read_file, ls, glob, grep, tool_search, get_project_fact, list_project_facts, search_project_facts, list_vulnerabilities, get_vulnerability, get_asset, query_assets, list_knowledge_risk_types, get_tool_execution, wait_tool_execution, batch_task_list, batch_task_get, manage_webshell_list, c2_event, c2_file]
```

`audit_backend` is a choice of `openai` (default, chat-completions JSON from the prompt) or `typesafe` (TypeSafe Jev). Custom audit-strategy text is evaluated as structured `operatorPolicy` questions; built-in destructive rules remain a hard floor. Jev cannot rewrite arguments, including in review-edit mode. The built-in default prompt is already encoded as Jev questions and is not copied into state.

`audit_model` supports partial configuration on the OpenAI backend. Empty fields inherit from the resolved default AI channel. On the TypeSafe backend, `api_key` is required and is **not** inherited from the main model; blank `base_url` uses `https://api.typesafe.ai`, and blank `model` uses `jev-latest`.

TypeSafe permits only `https://api.typesafe.ai` by default. Before starting the server, operators can authorize custom gateways through `CYBERSTRIKE_TYPESAFE_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS`, a comma-separated list of full base URLs such as `https://jev.example.com,https://gateway.example.com/jev`. Use `$env:CYBERSTRIKE_TYPESAFE_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS='https://jev.example.com'` in Windows PowerShell, `export CYBERSTRIKE_TYPESAFE_ALLOWED_BASE_URLS='https://jev.example.com'` on Linux/macOS, or a container environment variable, then restart the service. The UI/configuration value must exactly match an entry after trimming surrounding whitespace and trailing `/`; scheme, port and path are significant. Wildcards, embedded credentials, query strings and fragments are not accepted.

Only server operators can authorize internal or HTTP gateways. Authorization permits sending the API key and audit context to that service, so entries must identify controlled endpoints. Connection tests and audit requests share this restriction and never follow HTTP redirects. An unapproved endpoint returns 400 from connection tests and causes automatic audit to reject the action. To revoke a custom gateway, remove its environment entry and restart the service, then restore the default or another approved model address.

## Recommended Approval Strategy

### 1. Start With Humans, Then Delegate Gradually

At the beginning, prefer:

- `default_reviewer: human`
- Only clearly read-only tools in `tool_whitelist`
- Human approval for file writes, command execution, C2 tasks, and WebShell operations

After observing audit logs, move repeated low-risk operations into the allowlist.

### 2. Use A Small Model When Humans Cannot Keep Up

When pending approvals start piling up, switch routine review to the Audit Agent:

```yaml
hitl:
  default_reviewer: audit_agent
  audit_model:
    model: "your-small-reviewer-model"
```

Good candidates for small-model review:

- Read-only queries
- Reconnaissance
- Port and service scans
- Directory enumeration
- Non-destructive validation commands

Keep human review for:

- Deleting, overwriting, or clearing data
- Modifying permissions, passwords, or accounts
- Persistence, lateral movement, and high-risk C2 tasks
- Writes against production targets

### 3. Encode Your Policy In The Prompt

The Audit Agent prompt should describe an operational policy, not just say “be careful.” Make it explicit:

- Which low-risk actions are normally approved
- Which destructive actions must be rejected
- Which cases require escalation to a human
- How review-edit mode may narrow arguments

Example policy snippet:

```text
Approve routine reconnaissance, read-only queries, and port scans by default.
Reject file deletion, database clearing, account or permission changes, persistence, and stopping critical services.
Reject actions outside the user-authorized target scope.
In review-edit mode, you may narrow paths, targets, or command arguments before approving, but must not expand the attack surface.
```

On the OpenAI backend this text is a chat system prompt. On TypeSafe Jev it becomes an `operatorPolicy` overlay evaluated as structured questions; built-in destructive rules remain a hard floor, and Jev will not rewrite arguments. If the text is empty or identical to the built-in default, Jev uses the built-in questions only and does not copy the long prompt into state.

### 4. Keep The Allowlist Conservative

Allowlisted tools skip approval, so keep the list stable and low-risk. Recommended examples:

- `read_file`
- `ls`
- `glob`
- `grep`
- `tool_search`
- Project and vulnerability reads: `get_project_fact`, `list_project_facts`, `search_project_facts`, `list_vulnerabilities`, `get_vulnerability`
- Asset and knowledge-metadata reads: `get_asset`, `query_assets`, `list_knowledge_risk_types`
- Execution and task-state reads: `get_tool_execution`, `wait_tool_execution`, `batch_task_list`, `batch_task_get`
- Local management-metadata reads: `manage_webshell_list`, `c2_event`, `c2_file`

These built-in MCP reads remain constrained by RBAC and resource scope; the allowlist only bypasses HITL approval and does not grant additional access. `list_dir` is effective only when that is the actual tool name; the Eino filesystem directory-listing tool is named `ls`.

Avoid globally allowlisting:

- Arbitrary shell execution tools
- File write/delete tools
- C2 task tools
- WebShell command execution tools
- Nominally read-only tools that send requests to a target or external service, such as `webshell_file_read`, `webshell_file_list`, and `search_knowledge_base`
- Multiplexed tools whose actions include both reads and writes, such as `c2_session`, `c2_listener`, `c2_profile`, and `c2_task_manage`

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| Off | Local labs or fully trusted toolchains |
| Approval | Approve/reject only |
| Review-edit | Let the Audit Agent narrow arguments before approval |

If you configured a small audit model, start with **Approval** mode. Use **Review-edit** only when you want the AI to safely narrow paths, target ranges, or command arguments.

## Operations Tips

- Review **Human-in-the-loop → Audit logs** regularly and tune allowlists/prompts.
- In high-risk environments, keep `default_reviewer: human` and use the Audit Agent only for recommendations.
- If the small-model reviewer fails, CyberStrikeAI rejects conservatively by default.
- After changing `hitl.audit_model`, click **Test audit model** in the settings page.
- For production, customer, or real business systems, keep a human as the final approver.
