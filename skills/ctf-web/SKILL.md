name: ctf-web
description: Provides web exploitation techniques for CTF challenges. Use when the target is primarily an HTTP application, API, browser client, template engine, identity flow, or smart-contract frontend/backend surface, including XSS, SQLi, SSTI, SSRF, XXE, JWT, auth bypass, file upload, request smuggling, OAuth/OIDC, SAML, prototype pollution, and similar web bugs. Do not use it for native binary memory corruption, reverse engineering of standalone executables, disk or memory forensics, or pure cryptanalysis unless the web flaw is still the main path to the flag.

## When to Pivot

- If the target is a native binary, custom VM, or firmware image, switch to `/ctf-reverse` first.
- If the HTTP bug only gives you code execution and the hard part becomes memory corruption or seccomp escape, switch to `/ctf-pwn`.
- If the "web" challenge really turns on JWT math, custom MACs, or crypto primitives, switch to `/ctf-crypto`.
- If the web challenge involves analyzing logs, PCAPs, or recovering artifacts from a web server, switch to `/ctf-forensics`.
- If the challenge requires gathering intelligence from public web sources, DNS records, or social media before exploitation, switch to `/ctf-osint`.

## First-Pass Workflow

1. Identify the real boundary: browser only, backend only, mixed app, or auth flow.
2. Capture one normal request/response pair for every major feature before fuzzing.
3. Enumerate hidden functionality from JS bundles, response headers, routes, and alternate methods.
4. Classify the likely bug family: injection, authz, parser mismatch, upload, trust proxy, state machine, or client-side execution.
5. Build the smallest proof first: leak, bypass, or primitive. Save full exploit chaining for later.

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Recon
curl -sI https://target.com
ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
curl -s https://target.com/robots.txt

# SQLi quick test
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --batch --dbs

# JWT decode (no verification)
echo '<token>' | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq .

# Cookie decode (Flask)
flask-unsign --decode --cookie '<cookie>'
flask-unsign --unsign --cookie '<cookie>' --wordlist rockyou.txt

# SSTI probes
curl "https://target.com/page?name={{7*7}}"
curl "https://target.com/page?name={{config}}"

# Request inspection
curl -v -X POST https://target.com/api -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## First Questions to Answer

- Is the flag likely in the browser, an API response, a local file, a database row, or an internal service?
- Does the app trust user-controlled data in templates, redirects, file paths, headers, serialized objects, or background jobs?
- Are there multiple parsers disagreeing with each other: proxy vs app, URL parser vs fetcher, sanitizer vs browser, serializer vs filter?
- Can you turn the bug into a smaller primitive first: read one file, forge one token, call one internal endpoint, trigger one bot visit?

## High-Value Recon Checks

- Read the HTML, inline scripts, and bundled JS before guessing the API surface.
- Compare what the UI submits with what the backend accepts; optional JSON fields often unlock hidden paths.
- Check obvious metadata and helper paths early: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/.well-known/`, `/admin`, `/debug`, `/.git/`, `/.env`.
- Try alternate verbs and content types on interesting routes: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `TRACE`, JSON, form, multipart, XML.
- Treat file upload, PDF/export, webhook, OAuth callback, and admin bot features as likely exploit multipliers.

## Fast Pattern Map

- SQL errors, odd filtering, or state-dependent DB behavior: start with [sql-injection.md](sql-injection.md).
- Templating, file reads, SSRF, command execution, XML, or parser bugs: start with [server-side.md](server-side.md) and [server-side-exec.md](server-side-exec.md).
- XSS, CSP bypass, admin bot, client routing, DOM issues, or scriptless exfiltration: start with [client-side.md](client-side.md).
- Session forgery, hidden admin routes, JWT, OAuth, SAML, or weak trust boundaries: start with [auth-and-access.md](auth-and-access.md), [auth-jwt.md](auth-jwt.md), and [auth-infra.md](auth-infra.md).
- Node.js apps, prototype pollution, VM sandboxes, or SSRF into internal services: add [node-and-prototype.md](node-and-prototype.md).
- Smart contract frontends or blockchain-integrated apps: add [web3.md](web3.md).

## Common Chain Shapes

- Recon -> hidden route -> auth bypass -> internal file read -> token or flag
- XSS or HTML injection -> admin bot -> privileged action -> secret leak
- Traversal or upload -> config/source leak -> secret recovery -> session forgery
- SSRF -> metadata or internal API -> credential leak -> code execution
- SQLi or NoSQL injection -> credential bypass -> second-stage template or upload abuse

## Deep-Dive Notes

Use [field-notes.md](field-notes.md) once you have confirmed the challenge is truly web-heavy and you need the long exploit catalog.

- Recon, SQLi, XSS, traversal, JWT, SSTI, SSRF, XXE, and command injection quick notes
- Deserialization, race conditions, file upload to RCE, and multi-stage chain examples
- Node, OAuth/SAML, CI/CD, Web3, bot abuse, CSP bypasses, and modern browser tricks
- CVE-shaped playbooks and older challenge patterns that still show up in modern CTFs

## Common Flag Locations

- Files: `/flag.txt`, `/flag`, `/app/flag.txt`, `/home/*/flag*`
- Environment: `/proc/self/environ`, process command line, debug config dumps
- Database: tables named `flag`, `flags`, `secret`, or seeded challenge content
- HTTP: custom headers, archived responses, hidden routes, admin exports
- Browser: hidden DOM nodes, `data-*` attributes, inline state objects, source maps
